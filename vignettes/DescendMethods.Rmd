## Contents of the package

In this package are included two principal functions: `GradD()` and `SteepD()`. These perform the algorithm of optimization called Gradient Descend and Steepest Descend, respectively. These functions are especially build to perform an optimization in order to find $\beta$ parameters of a liner model, i.e. 
$$
Y=X\beta + \varepsilon
$$

```{r setup}
library(DescendMethods)
```
